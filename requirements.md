TDD Example 1 - Student learning Chinese

User Story: As a student learning Chinese, I want a way to be able to see the words of numbers in both English and Chinese, but not at the same to allow me to memorize the words more.

Example: Users are able to toggle between English and Chinese, which changes the language the words in the popup menu are in.

Example: The toggle function only allows the user to see the numbers in one language at a time, which promotes memorization of the characters.

TDD Example 2 - User with small screen

User Story: As a user with a cellphone that has a small screen, I want the app to have visual cues to help me play the game.

Example: The app has included the ability to zoom in onto a specific button. When the user clicks on a button, it will zoom in onto that button to allow for the user to pick a number.

Example: Whenever the user inputs an incorrect answer, the cells where an error could have occurred are highlighted in red.
